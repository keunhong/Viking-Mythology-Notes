Pytheas of Massalias
    - Greek geographer
    - 330-300 BCE surveys coast of western Europe
    - Voyage recorded in of the Ocean, now lost
    - Six days north of Britain, discovered Thule, a land inhabited by barbarians. Describes meagre diet, difficult climate, trade with other northern tribes.
    - Thule = Norway?

Strabo

    - Describes victory rite of Cimbri (german tribe), in which garlanded prisoners had throats cut into sacrificial cauldron.
        Gundestrup Bowl - Discovered in Jutland in Denmark, once inhabited by the Cimbri
        Detail of the Gundestrop bowl - could be the victory rite Strabo was speaking of

Tacitus
    - Roman historian, 56-117 CE
    - Major works, the Annals and Histories
        - Emperor(?) gave Tacitus gave a lasting hatred of tyrrany
        - Gives up politics to become a writer
        - Large slabs of these works are missing
        - Augustus 14 CE
    - Annals 3.65: "This I regard as history's highest function, to let no worthy action be uncommemorated, and to hold out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds."
        - Hopefully future governments would behave better fearing posterity.
    - Germania written 98 CE
        - Tacitus writes about Germany in critique of the Roman empire. Sees them as people of great virtue (even though he sees them as barbarians).
            - Noble savage. Haven't become corrupted by civiliztion
    - Famous for having a very pithy style. Very short and to the point. Concise.
    - Described the end of a Roman military compaign. He said they created desolation and called it peace.

How can we check Tacitus' reliability?
    - Archeology
    - What other people wrote. What other classical authors said.
    - The vikings were the descendents of the germanic tribes. Vikings remained pagan. Have surviving poems from the Edda. Works from Snorri Sturluson--the author of the prose Edda.
        - (problem that the works were written after some people converted to Christianity)
        - But we cn sort of verify what Tacitus said was true.

What does Tacitus say of German social organization?
    - Chiefs, cheiftans. Chiefs don't lead authority, they lead by example and persuasion.
    - Chooses chiefs by birth and generals by valor.
        - When they go into battle the person with actual experience leads.
    - Dishonorable to survive a battle of chief died.
    - Women were a lot more equal. Adultery was less common. No prostitutes. 
    - Dowries were given to the women instead of the other way around.

    - They hung traitors on trees.
    - Cowards were suffocated in mud.

    - For small offenses they would take cattle etc. and give to local king.
    - Most quarrels ended with blood.

    - For the most part they are monogomas.
    - The matromonial bond is nonetheless strict among them. ~ Polygamy for creating political alliances.

Government
    11. On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of greater importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance, that what is referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely discussed by the chiefs.  They assemble, unless upon some sudden emergency, on stated days, either at the new or full moon, which they account the most auspicious season for beginning any enterprise. Nor do they, in their computation of time, reckon, like us, by the number of days, but of nights. In this way they arrange their business; in this way they fix their appointments; so that, with them, the night seems to lead the day.  An inconvenience produced by their liberty is, that they do not all assemble at a stated time, as if it were in obedience to a command; but two or three days are lost in the delays of convening. When they all think fit,  they sit down armed.  Silence is proclaimed by the priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power. Then the king, or chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age, birth, military renown, or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention rather from their ability to persuade, than their authority to command. If a proposal displease, the assembly reject it by an inarticulate murmur; if it prove agreeable, they clash their javelins;  for the most honorable expression of assent among them is the sound of arms.

What does he say about agerman mythology and religion?
    - They worship Isis. The Egyptian goddess of fertility.
    - They do not envision their deities as human form. They rather envision them as stuff.
    - They don't build enclosed temples. Everything's open.
        - Worshipped in groves of trees etc. Thought spirits wanted to be free.

    9. Of the gods, Mercury is the principal object of their adoration; whom, on certain days, they think it lawful to propitiate even with human victims. To Hercules and Mars they offer the animals usually allotted for sacrifice. Some of the Suevi also perform sacred rites to Isis. What was the cause and origin of this foreign worship, I have not been able to discover; further than that her being represented with the symbol of a galley, seems to indicate an imported religion. They conceive it unworthy the grandeur of celestial beings to confine their deities within walls, or to represent them under a human similitude: woods and groves are their temples; and they affix names of divinity to that secret power, which they behold with the eye of adoration alone.

    - Divination. Highly superstitious. Omens.
