A myth is generally a story which "embodies a belief regarding some fact or phenomenon of experience, and in which often the forces of nature and the soul are personifies; a sacred narrative regarding a god, a hero, or the origin of the world or of a people, etc."

On the one hand, Genesis 1:1-5, Ovid, and Voluspa all give a very mystical almost fantasy-like description of the origin of the world and its inhabitants. There is, of course, no guideline that tells us whether to interpret the language literally or figuratively; however, common sense tells us that taking these stories literally would be unwise. These three texts fall perfectly into the definition of a myth given above. They attempt to explain how the world came to be by personifying an almighty power.

On the other hand, the Declaration of Independence is somewhat different from the other three in that the allusions to "unalienable Rights" endowed about by a "Creator" are not used to explain why something exists, but rather as the foundation of an ideal in which the United States was founded. Thus this is most likely closer to history than myth.

In classifying I assumed that the language in all three texts were in part metaphorical--including language that is clearly not to be taken literally.
