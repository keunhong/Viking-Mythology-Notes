COSMOGONY

Voluspa, v. 3
Young were the years when Ymir made his settlement
There was no sand nor sea nor cool waves
Earth was nowhere nor the sky above
Chaos yawned, grass was there nowhere

Primordial chaos = Ginnungagap

"Gaping abyss" (Folke Strom) or "gaping emptiness" (Patricia Terry)
= gap

"No sand nor sea" and no Earth, no sky
no pairs or opposities



Snorri's account
- Does not say what Ginnungagap is
- Nifleheim (region of ice) to the north
- Muspell (region of heat and light and burning) to the south
- Fire and ice meet


Voluspa, v. 3
    Young were the years when
        Ymir made his settlement
    There was no sand nor sea
        nor cool waves
    Earth was nowhere nor the
        sky above
    Chaos yawned, grass was
        there nowhere

Ovid's Metamorphoses, v. 1
    Before the seas, and this
        terrestrial ball,
    And heav'n's high canopy, that
        covers all,
    One was the face of Nature; if
        a face:
    Rather a rude and indigested
        mass:
    A lifeless lump, unfashion'd, and
        unfram'd
    Of jarring  seeds; and justly
        Chaos nam'd.

Voluspa v. 4, 6
    First the sons of Bur brought up the Earth
    ---
    Then all the Power went to the thrones of fate,
    The sacrosanct gods, and considered this:
    To night and her children they gave names,
    Morning they named and midday,
    Afternoon and evening, to reckon up the years


    They're raising it up out of primordial waters
    ---
    Time starting, separation of night and day
    Giving names to things creates order
    Act of order is act of speech.
        --> In genesis god _says_ "let there be light"


Intermission - Voluspa in 14 words
---

First there was nothing
From Ymirr's body the Earth
Order from chaos

<Gods, nature and the Supernatural>

Ymir, Bur, Odin
    - According to Snorri, Ymir is born out of the melting ice when heat and cold meet in Ginnungagap
    - Out of this melted ice also forms Audhumla, primordial cow.
    - Audhumla licks the frost for three days until a human figure emerges.
    - This human figure is Buri. His son is Bor.
    - Bor fathers Odin, Vi, and Ve

Rig Veda X.129
    The existent was not, nor was the non-existent; there was
        no realm of air, nor sky beyond it [...]
    At first concealed in darkness, this all was indiscriminated
        chaos [...]
    Whence comes this creation? The gods are later than this
        world's production. Who knows then when it first came
        into being?

    - Note:
        - Gods do not exist prior to the creation of the cosmos
        - Gods are born
        - Gods ultimately die
    - What does this imply about the (Norse) pagan view of the gods?
    - How does it compare to the monotheistic God of the Abrahamic religions?

Gylfaginning
    They took Ymir and transported him to the middle of
    Ginnungagap, and out of him made the earth, out of his
    blood the sea and they lakes. The earth was made of the
    flesh and rocks of the bones, ston,e and scree they
    made out of teeth and molars and of bones that
    had been broken, ...

    - They also took his skull and made out of it the sky and set it up over the earth...




Main point of lecture?
    There are parallels between creation myths.
        - Some dude creates stuff and creates order from chaos.
        - Why are they so similar.
