The rich man in his castle
The poor man at his gate
God made them high and lowly
And ordered their estate

- Divine shit for social order



Rigsthula, vv. 5-7

[Rig] lay in the middle of the bed,
With the couple of the household on either side.
...
There he was for three nights together ...
Nine months passed after that.

Great grandmother had a baby, poured water
over it,
Dark as flax, they called it Thrall


Thrall
- What does Thrall look like?
    - Big, ugly, vigorous, crooked black, long heel
- What does he to for a living?
    - Doing the heavy labor jobs.
- Marry's Slave-girl
    - They form babbies

Rigsthula, vv. 19-21
- What are the names of Farmer's children?
    - Soldier, Farmers, blah. Free men but people working the land.

Rigsthula, v. 34
Mother gave birth to a boy, wrapped him in silk,
Poured water over him, had him named Lord
- What does Lord look like?
    - Handsome and fine.
- They wrap him in silk.
- What does he do?
    - 
- What happens to his son, young Kin?
    - Conquers a Kingdom?

- What conclusions can we draw?
    Bear in mind:
        - Physical descriptions of Thrall, Farmer, Lord
        - Their occupations

    - People were born into three classes.
    - A society that is stratified
    - Correspondence between physical makeup and class you're born into
    - Poems believes in nature rather than nurture


 
Prose Edda 3rd part - Skáldskaparmál
    - Leads up to the account of the  origin of poetry
    - The gods kill the giant Theassis
    - Theassis' sister is pissed off. She comes to see the gods.

    - What is going on here?
        - Somebody had to compensate. Reflects the viking legal system.
            - A tribal social and legal setup.
        - The Aesir are part of one group. The Aesir killed Theassis

    - Tribal society
        - No police
        - No central government
        - Laws are social convention
        - Rely on the kinship network to defend interests
        - Extend my intermarraige
        - If someone's steals or kills, you then have to steal in return or kill
            member in return. Not necessarily perpetrator.
        - You could make up for killing by paying.
        - Advantage: avoid long protracted blood shit
