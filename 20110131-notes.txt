THEORIES OF MYTH 1
Myth, allegory, and truth in the ancient world

Theories of Myth: A rough map
    - Myth as primitive science (Edward Tylor)
    - Myth as expressions of psyche (Freud, Jung, Campbell)
    - Myth and ritual (James Frazer)
    - Structuralist approaches to myth (Levi-Strauss)

Some questions address by these theories
    - is myth about the external world or is it about the mind?
    - What is the function of myth? (What does it do?)
    - Is myth superceded by science? (Is myth still necessary?)
    - What needs does it fulfill?

Muthos and Logos
    - Mythos: orality - story/narrative
    - Logos: literacy - word, speech, discourse, reason

Hypononoia and Allegory
    - Allegory = (Literally) 'other-seaking'
    - Hyponnoia ('under-meaning')
    - A definition: "allegorical interpretation ... is understood as explaining a work, or a figure in myth, or any created entity, as if there were another sense to which it referred"
        - Rita Copeland and Peter Struck "The Cambridge Companion to Allegory," p 2


Plotinus
    - Neoplatonism

Plotinus' Three Hypostases
    - THE ONE
    - Nous - 'divine mind', 'intellect ', 'intellectual-principle'
    - Psyche - 'soul', 'all-soul'
    - Hule - the material world

Plotinus on Homer
    - "'let us flee then to the beloved Fatherland' ... but what is this fligt? How are we to gain the open sea? For Odysseus is surely a prarable to us when he commands the flight from the sorceries of Circe or Calypso - not content to linger for all the pleasure offered to his eyes and all the delight of sense filling his days."
        - Ennead 1.6.8

Porphyry
    "High at the head a branching olive grows,
    And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs. 
    A cavern pleasant, though involv'd in night, 
    Beneath it lies, the Naiades' delight: 
    Where bowls and urns of workmanship divine 
    And massy beams in native marble shine; 
    On which the Nymphs amazing webs display, 
    Of purple hue, and exquisite array. 
    The busy bees within the urns secure 
    Honey delicious, and like nectar pure. 
    Perpetual waters through the grotto glide, 
    A lofty gate unfolds on either side; 
    That to the north is pervious to mankind; 
    The sacred south t' immortals is consign'd." 
    - Obscurity/oddity of passage
    - Cave unkown on lthaca
    - Homer could not expect his audience to take literally a cave with one entrace for gods and another for mortals
    - Nature does not provide caves of this sort
