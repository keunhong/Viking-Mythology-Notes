    - Baldr is not one of the Vanir, he's the son of Odin.
    - He doesn't actually come back, he dies and stays dead
    - Sees it as a male initiation into adulthood

    - A correspondence between the story of Baldr's death and an incident from Gautreks Saga concerning the odinic warrior Starkadr.

        - Re-enacting Odin's sacrifice of himself on the world tree. Havanmar.
            - A "mock" sacrifice.
            - Starkadr jabs Vikar with a reed.
            - A mock sacrifice turns into the real thing.
        - This resembles to what happens to Baldr.
